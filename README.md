# Warning

This is totally a work in progress. As of this writing (Aug 21, 2016) I only started working on this yesterday. :)

Also, I haven't started on Montezuma's revenge yet. But I do intend to.

Comments/criticisms/suggestions/pull requests welcome, as always.

# Results

## Stochastic MDP Environment

![State visits](https://github.com/EthanMacdonald/h-DQN/fig/mdp-actor-critic-visits.png)

Fig 1. Each subplot shows the number of times the actor-critic agent visited a given state (averaged over 1000 episodes).

To reproduce the figure above run `python actor_critic.py` from the command line
